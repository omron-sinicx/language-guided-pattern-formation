overview: |
  This paper explores leveraging the vast knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle pattern formation challenges for swarm robotics systems. A new framework, named LGPF (Language-Guided Pattern Formation), is proposed to address these challenges. The framework breaks down the pattern formation into two key components: pattern synthesis and swarm robotics control. For the former, this study utilizes the exceptional few-shot generalizability of LLMs to translate high-level natural language descriptions into the desired spatial pattern coordinates. This approach allows for overcoming previous limitations in representing and designing complex patterns. The framework further employs a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the swarm robots in forming the specified pattern while avoiding collisions. The decentralized policies learned with the CTDE-based MARL algorithm consider coordination between robots without direct communication under a partially observable setup. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. These experiments validate LGPF's effectiveness in accurately and safely forming diverse user-specified patterns.

  - title: An LLM as Swarm Pattern Generator
    text: |
      The following image shows an overview of our LGPF.
      Given a desired pattern in language (e.g., circle, tree, house), we ask an LLM to generate coordinates of swarm robots.
      Then, the robots are ordered to move to assigned coordinates. The robots are trained by a multi-agent RL algorithm so
      that they move smoothly to target positions while avoiding collisions and solving partial observability.

  - title: Example Patterns Generated by an LLM
    text: |
      We tested the ability of an LLM to generate patterns for swarm robots. As the following image shows, an LLM is able to generate diverse patterns,
      ranging from alphabets, geometric shapes, and even complex objects such as houses. This is surprising since, in contrast to
      line drawing, an LLM needs to take into account the number of robots so that dots representing an object indeed look like a specified
      object.

  - title: Swarm Robot Patterns in a Simulator
    text: |
      Generating coodinates alone is far less sufficient for actually letting swarm robots to form a pattern. We trained the swarm robots to
      move to target positions while avoiding collisions with other robots and solving partial observability due to local observation of each
      robot. The following image shows actuall patterns formed by the swarm robots in a simulated environment.

  - title: Swarm Robot Patterns in a Real Environment
    text: |
      Finally, we transferred policies of swarm robots to a real environment. The following image shows how our robots react to changing orders
      and how they move to form desired shapes. For details of the robots we used, please refer to the "maru" paper cited at the bottom of this
      project page.

  - title: OMRON SINIC X is Hiring!
    text: |
      OMRON SINIC X continuously hires internship students.
      We are a completely research-oriented company aiming at publishing papers in top conferences and journals such as IROS.
      We encourage internship students to present their results by themselves and provide travel support. As a matter of course,
      we provide competitive salary, accomodation, and visa support. If you live in Japan, remote work is also possible.

      For details, please refer to [call for interns](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/en/internship/).
