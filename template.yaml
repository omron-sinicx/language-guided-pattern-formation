overview: |
  This paper explores leveraging the vast knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle pattern formation challenges for swarm robotics systems. A new framework, named LGPF (Language-Guided Pattern Formation), is proposed to address these challenges. The framework breaks down the pattern formation into two key components: pattern synthesis and swarm robotics control. For the former, this study utilizes the exceptional few-shot generalizability of LLMs to translate high-level natural language descriptions into the desired spatial pattern coordinates. This approach allows for overcoming previous limitations in representing and designing complex patterns. The framework further employs a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the swarm robots in forming the specified pattern while avoiding collisions. The decentralized policies learned with the CTDE-based MARL algorithm consider coordination between robots without direct communication under a partially observable setup. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. These experiments validate LGPF's effectiveness in accurately and safely forming diverse user-specified patterns.

  - title: Markdown examples
    text: |
      Here's our demo text showcasing the power of markdown and KaTeX integration!
      Markdown allows you to easily format text using simple syntax.
      - **bold**
      - *italic*
      - `inline code`.

      You can also create headings of various levels:
      # Heading Level 1
      ## Heading Level 2
      ### Heading Level 3
      #### Heading Level 4
      Markdown allows you to create tables like the following:
      #### Motion Planning (MP) Dataset
      markdown version
      |Method|Opt|Exp|Hmean|
      |--|--|--|--|
      |BF| 65.8 (63.8, 68.0)| 44.1 (42.8, 45.5) | 44.8 (43.4, 46.3)|
      |WA*| 68.4 (66.5, 70.4)| 35.8 (34.5, 37.1) | 40.4 (39.0, 41.8)|
      |**Neural A*** | **87.7 (86.6, 88.9)**| 40.1 (38.9, 41.3) | 52.0 (50.7, 53.3)|

      Of course, you can also directly write tables in HTML if needed. For more details, refer to the [UIKit Table documentation](https://getuikit.com/docs/table).
